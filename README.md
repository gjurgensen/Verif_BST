This repo is an ongoing attempt to verify a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in C, using the "Verifiable C" framework for Coq.

## Project Layout
- `bst.c`: The C source file being verified 
- `bst.v`: Automatically generated by CompCert. Contains the Coq AST of the `bst.c` source code
- `bst_spec.v`: Coq definitions of BSTs, their operators, and properties
- `bst_holes.v`: Coq definition of BSTs with a "hole". Useful in describing partial trees. 
- `Verif_bst.v`: The main verification file. Contains the representation definitions, function specifications, and main proofs.
- `my_tactics.v`: Misc. tactics

## Status
The proofs for `search` and `insert` are complete.

The proof for `delete` is a work in progress.

## Misc. notes 
To generate `bst.v` from `bst.c`, use `clightgen`:

```sh
clightgen -normalize bst.c
```
